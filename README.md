# Advent-of-Code-2020
My code for Advent of Code 2020. Solutions are in Python, Go, Bash, Smalltalk, and any other languages I decide to try writing one in. Feel free to send a pull request if there are any inaccuracies or code doesn't run properly!

Submissions in Scratch are located [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/28216903/projects/), and for fun, I only make use of lists, no variables
